## Step 2 : Laravel 9 Create Authentication

```
composer require laravel/ui
```
Install bootstrap auth using the below command.
```
php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
```
Now, install npm and run dev for better UI results.

npm run dev
```

## Step 3 : Install Composer Packages
Now, we will install spatie package for ACL.
```
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
```
Also, install the form collection package using the below command.
composer require laravelcollective/html
Optional: The service provider will automatically get registered. Or you may manually add the service provider in your config/app.php file.
```
'providers' => [
	....
	Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider::class,
],
```
Now, publish this package as below.
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider"
```
